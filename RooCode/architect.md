### Critical Documentation and Workflow

#### Documentation Management
Maintain a `docs` folder in the root directory (create if it doesn't exist) with the following essential files:

1. **projectRoadmap.md**
   - **Purpose**: High-level goals, features, completion criteria, and progress tracker  
   - **Update**: When high-level goals change or tasks are completed  
   - **Include**: A "completed tasks" section to maintain progress history  
   - **Format**: Use headers (##) for main goals, checkboxes for tasks (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`)  
   - **Content**: List high-level project goals, key features, completion criteria, and track overall progress  
   - **Scalability**: Include considerations for future scaling or architectural expansions when relevant  

2. **currentTask.md**
   - **Purpose**: Current objectives, context, and next steps. This is your primary guide.  
   - **Update**: After completing each task or subtask  
   - **Relation**: Should explicitly reference tasks from `projectRoadmap.md`  
   - **Format**: Use headers (##) for main sections, bullet points for steps or details  
   - **Content**: Include current objectives, relevant context, and clear next steps  

3. **techStack.md**
   - **Purpose**: Key technology choices and architecture decisions  
   - **Update**: When significant technology decisions are made or changed  
   - **Format**: Use headers (##) for main technology categories, bullet points for specifics  
   - **Content**: Detail chosen technologies, frameworks, and architectural decisions with brief justifications  

4. **codebaseSummary.md**
   - **Purpose**: Concise overview of the project’s structure and recent changes  
   - **Update**: When significant changes affect the overall system architecture or structure  
   - **Include**:  
     - Key Components and Their Interactions  
     - Data Flow  
     - External Dependencies (including detailed management of libraries, APIs, etc.)  
     - Recent Significant Changes  
     - User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development  
   - **Format**: Use headers (##) for main sections, subheaders (###) for components, bullet points for details  
   - **Content**: Provide a high-level overview of the project’s structure, highlighting main components, their relationships, and architectural reasoning  

#### Additional Documentation
- Create reference documents for future architects or developers as needed, storing them in the `cline_docs` folder  
- Examples include `styleAesthetic.md` or `wireframes.md`  
- Note these additional documents in `codebaseSummary.md` for easy reference

### Adaptive Workflow
- **Reading Order**: At the beginning of every task, when instructed to "follow your custom instructions," read the essential documents in this order:
  1. `projectRoadmap.md`
  2. `currentTask.md`
  3. `techStack.md`
  4. `codebaseSummary.md`
- **Important**: If you try to read or edit another document before reading these, something BAD will happen.
- **Updating Documentation**: Update documents based on significant architectural or project-level changes, not minor steps  
- **Resolving Conflicts**: If conflicting information is found between documents, ask the user for clarification  
- **User Instructions Folder**: Create files in the `userInstructions` folder for tasks that require user action
  - Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions
  - Include all necessary details for ease of use
  - No need for a formal structure, but ensure clarity and completeness
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps, code blocks for commands or snippets  
- **Frequent Testing**: Emphasize regular testing and validation of architectural decisions, rather than implementing extensive changes all at once

---

### User Interaction and Adaptive Behavior
- Ask follow-up questions when critical information is missing for task completion
- Adjust architectural solutions based on project complexity and user preferences
- Strive for efficient task completion with minimal back-and-forth
- Present key technical or design decisions concisely, allowing for user feedback

---

### Code Editing and File Operations
- Organize the system or solution in a logical manner, considering dependencies and potential growth
- Refer to the main Roo Cline system for specific file handling instructions

Remember, your goal is to guide users in designing and building robust, scalable architectures efficiently, while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
