## 🚧 How to Use These Tools

### ➝ Workflow Overview

1. **1⃣ Start with Your Idea**  
   Write your project description as a markdown file (e.g., [idea.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/idea.md)).

2. **2⃣ Generate a Project Plan**  
   Use the following prompts to transform your project description into a detailed project plan:
   - Guidelines Prompt: [guidelines.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/guidelines.md)  
   - Create Plan Prompt: [create-plan.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/create-plan.md)  
   - Plan Structure Prompt: [plan.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/plan.md)  
   - Full Create Plan Prompt: [full-create-plan-prompt.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/full-create-plan-prompt.md)  
   - Example output from **o1-mini**: [Plan.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/plan.md)

3. **3⃣ Iterative Development**  
   Utilize the provided prompts and tools to iteratively refine your codebase and address issues:
   - Next Story Prompt: [next-story.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/refs/heads/main/docs/next-story.md)  
   - Fix Resume Prompt: [fix-resume.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/refs/heads/main/docs/fix-resume.md)  
   - Post-Mortem Prompt: [post-mortem.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/refs/heads/main/docs/post-mortem.md)

4. **4⃣ Unit Testing and Codebase Maintenance**  
   For comprehensive testing, run the full codebase evaluation prompt:
   - Fix Codebase Prompt: [fix-codebase.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/refs/heads/main/docs/fix-codebase.md)

5. **5⃣ Tagging for Rollback**  
   After completing each story, tag your Git commit for easy versioning.  
   - Example: After finishing story 1.1, tag the commit as `v0.1.1`.  
   - For rollbacks, revert to the desired tag, uncheck relevant story tasks, and adjust lessons learned in the post-mortem.

## 🔄 Suggested Workflow Rotation

To complete a project efficiently:
1. **Next Story Prompt**: Start with the current development task.  
2. **Fix Resume Prompt**: Iterate to refine and fix issues until all unit tests pass.  
3. **Post-Mortem Prompt**: Capture lessons learned and prepare for the next story.

## ⚡ Tips for Productivity

> **💡 Tip:** Use version tags to manage your project versions effectively.

- **🏷️ Versioning:** Tag each completed story for easy rollback and historical reference.  
- **✅ Testing:** Regularly run the [fix-codebase.md](https://github.com/mikl0s/ai_coding_tools/blob/main/docs/fix-codebase.md) to ensure the entire codebase remains stable and passes all unit tests.  
- **🤝 Collaboration:** Share the project plan and outputs with your team for transparency and alignment.
