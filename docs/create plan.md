# Prompt

Please generate a detailed project plan based on the project description below. Structure the plan using epics and stories. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Stories Scope**:  
   - Break down each epic into the smallest possible stories.  
   - Prioritize having more small stories over fewer large ones.
   - Ensure the plan adheres to the guidelines section below.
   - Include a one line description of each story.
   - Include a one line summary of the epic.
   - Include a one line of focus for testing of that story.

2. **Guidelines Compliance**:  
   - There is a guidelines section included below. Ensure the plan strictly adheres to those guidelines.  

3. **Format**:  
   - Use **Markdown** enclosed in a code block.  
   - Include **unchecked checkboxes** (`- [ ]`) for all epics and stories, so I can track progress.  

4. **Technology Stack**:  
   - Use Docker for services wherever possible (e.g., Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Redis).  

5. **Unit Testing**:  
   - Ensure unit tests are included for each story, not at the epic level.  

**Plan Structure**:  
- Begin with a list of epics.  
- Under each epic, list detailed stories with the smallest possible scope.  

**Output the plan in Markdown format, in a code block.**
